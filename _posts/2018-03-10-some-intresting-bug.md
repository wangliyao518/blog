What is the bug of the software? close your eye and think for three seconds, I'll give an official explanation:Bug is an English word, which means bug, defect, damage, poverty, eavesdropper, bug and so on. It is now known that some of the undiscovered defects or problems that are hidden in a computer system or program are known as bug (vulnerabilities).
什么是软件的bug？闭目思考三秒钟，我先给出官方的解释:bug是一个英文单词，本意是臭虫、缺陷、损坏、犯贫、窃听器、小虫等意思。现在人们将在电脑系统或程序中，隐藏着的一些未被发现的缺陷或问题统称为bug（漏洞）。
